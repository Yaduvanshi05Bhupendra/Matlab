## Matlab-Installation

Setting up MATLAB environment is a matter of few clicks. The installer can be downloaded from  [here](https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/web_downloads/)

MathWorks provides the licensed product, a trial version and a student version as well. You need to log into the site and wait a little for their approval.

After downloading the installer the software can be installed through few clicks.
